      <h2>About This Site</h2>
      <img src="Rocks.jpg"/>
      <p>Working on this site has made me understand that I have a love-hate relationship with coding. At least I was able to keep myself calm with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xDzrJKXOOY">this</a> music playing most of the time. I will continue to listen to this type of mmusic as I work on the rest of the projects that this class will have. The rest of this paragraph is filler to make the page look more filled out. Did you know that at one point in time, Bloomington-Normal had three railroads running through it? There was the Chicago and Alton, the Illinois Central, and the Nickel Plate Road. The Illinois Central line was abandoned some time in the 1980's, while the Chicago and Alton is now under the ownership of Union Pacific, and the Nickel Plate Road is under the ownership of Norfolk Southern.</p>
      <p>This site was made for the  <a href="https://coursefinder.illinoisstate.edu/ctk/301/">CTK 301 Fall 2023</a> midterm exam. It was coded over the span of a week and a half, and is used to guage how much a student has learned throughout the semester. The rest of this paragraph is filler content to make the page look more complete. The Chicago Blackhawks and maybe the Bulls are the cities only hope in sports right now. The Cubs had a historically bad collapse, the White Sox had a terrible season, and the Bears just suck.</p>
