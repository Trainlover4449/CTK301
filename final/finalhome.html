    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Collin Maguire, and I a student studying game design at Illinois State University. I have been working on lots of card and board games so far, with most of my work being physical content production. In my free time, I am a railroad photographer and videographer documenting opperations in Northern Indiana, Northern and Central Illinois, and Eastern Iowa. Other hobbies include music, motor racing, nature photography, Dungeons and Dragons, camping, writing, and playing video games. I am involved in the Illinois State University Solar Racing Team, where I have been given the chance to race competitively for the first time in my life. A majority of my work on the car has been with the mechanical team, producing various parts for the car. I am also a member of the Eagle Scout class of 2022, haaving built new dugouts for a local baseball field, in hopes of sparking interest in rehabilitating the field.
